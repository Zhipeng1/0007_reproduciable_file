# 0007_reproduciable_file
### 1 This is the reproduciable file of the research "What is the cluster pattern of the Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) amount with its charging infrastructure, and what are the factors affecting the ULEV market share among England, Wales, and Scotland?"


### 2 The reproduciable file is "CASA_0007_assessment_3_code.ipynb" written by jupyter-notebook.
### 2.1 You could download this 0007_reproduciable_file zip and unzip it into your local machine and <ins>unzip one zip file named "NUTS_Level_1_(January_2018)_Boundaries.zip"</ins> in that. this is the shapefile of the regional level geographic data. Its original data size is beyond 25MB so I zipped it to upload here . ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91874485/149977399-4a9f9630-be18-4848-9a8e-bdef0a74f8c5.png)

### 2.2 [This is the local authority level geographic data needed in this study](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::local-authority-districts-may-2021-uk-bfe/about) , <ins>you need to download it manually and paste it into the same path locally</ins>
